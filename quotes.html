                     My eldest child learned that cooperative games, like League of Legends, are exciting and fun to work together. My younger child learned how to handle online communication in a safe environment.</p></p>

                     The benefits of having physical fitness at camp for me would be that I've been eating a lot better, I've been taking breaks regularly, my health has improved significantly, and my gameplay is noticeably better than its been in months.</p></p>

                     My three favorite things about summer camp? The social aspect, meeting new people, finding new people you can relate to within the gaming community. The teachers are very laid back, it doesn't feel like you're being coached or taught, it feels like you're getting advice from a friend and I really like that. And someone is there supporting me throughout the whole experience.</p></p>

                  <p>I think Hybrid would benefit families because parents need to work [remotely during the pandemic] and the kids needs to be preoccupied somehow. This is a great learning experience and it helps kids stay healthy and active.</p></p>
