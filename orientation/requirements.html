          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <ul class="unordered-list unordered-list--check">
            <li>Orientation is all online, via Discord! Discord is a free service, but requires an account to login. Students should have an account made prior to the start of their orientation week.</li>
            <li>Reliable internet connection</li>
            <li>Quiet learning environment with no distractions</li>
            <li>Consistently reliable internet connection</li>
            <li>Computer with a webcam and microphone</li>
            <li>IOS recommendations: There is always some wiggle room here, but as a general rule, gaming is better on Windows computers. Although orientation is possible on Apple computers, we recommend Windows 7, 8, or 10 for the best experience across multiple titles.</li>
            <li>
              PC specification recommendations:We use the Minecraft recommendations as a baseline. [click here]</li>

          <h3>Orientation Dates</h3>
          <p>We run an orientation every 3rd week of the month, from 5:30pm-7:00pm central time. (3:30pm pacific, 6:30pm eastern).
            <ul class="unordered-list">

              <li>February: 15th-19th</li>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>Orientation is a one-time, flat rate fee of $75 per student. After orientation is over, there will be no additional charges. Although we offer some incredible paid programs, our mission is to help create a better internet. We believe that starts with our kids. So to reduce as many barriers as possible, Hybrid membership is completely free after orientation! It should be easy to find a safe, friendly online space, and we hope that those values spread to the rest of the internet too.</p>
