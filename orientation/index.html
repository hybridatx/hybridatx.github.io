          <h3>Orientation Overview</h3>
          <p>Learn what it means to be a Hybrid. Here, students will learn the importance of physical, social, and emotional wellness, expand their gaming horizons, play games with other new members and orientation mentors, and get to know our rules and expectations. This sets the groundwork for all students and gets everyone on the same page from day one. Later, when they join the larger community as a member, they'll be ready!</p><a class="btn" href="#">Let's get started!</a>

          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <ul class="unordered-list unordered-list--check">
            <li>Orientation is all online, via Discord! Discord is a free service, but requires an account to login. Students should have an account made prior to the start of their orientation week.</li>
            <li>Reliable internet connection</li>
            <li>Quiet learning environment with no distractions</li>
            <li>Consistently reliable internet connection</li>
            <li>Computer with a webcam and microphone</li>
            <li>IOS recommendations: There is always some wiggle room here, but as a general rule, gaming is better on Windows computers. Although orientation is possible on Apple computers, we recommend Windows 7, 8, or 10 for the best experience across multiple titles.</li>
            <li>
              PC specification recommendations:We use the Minecraft recommendations as a baseline. [click here]</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Orientation Dates</h3>
          <p>We run an orientation every 3rd week of the month, from 5:30pm-7:00pm central time. (3:30pm pacific, 6:30pm eastern).
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <h5>Winter Dates:</h5>
              <li>February: 15th-19th</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <h5>Spring Dates:</h5>
              <li>March: 15th-19th (AISD Spring Break)</li>
              <li>April: 19th-23rd</li>
              <li>May: 17th-21st</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unordered-list">
              <h5>Summer and Fall Dates TBA</h5>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>Orientation is a one-time, flat rate fee of $75 per student. After orientation is over, there will be no additional charges. Although we offer some incredible paid programs, our mission is to help create a better internet. We believe that starts with our kids. So to reduce as many barriers as possible, Hybrid membership is completely free after orientation! It should be easy to find a safe, friendly online space, and we hope that those values spread to the rest of the internet too.</p>
