          <h3>Adult-moderated <br/>online environment</h3>
          <p>Hybrid is members-only, family-friendly, and monitored by background-checked adults who ensure a healthy community environment. Every student has gone through orientation and is aware of our rules and expectations, and our staff makes sure they're staying within these guidelines. If a member does require a note home, we can temporarily restrict access or even remove them entirely as a last resort. Peace of mind comes easier when you know your kids are playing with Hybrids.</p>
